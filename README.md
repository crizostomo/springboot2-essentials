## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a compilation that contains all the exercises applied from zero to secured APIs using CRUD. It will give you a list of all of them copied here.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install/have installed and how to install them.

```
- Java Language
- IDE - Intellij
- Postman (this is a plus)
- docker
- Have the MySQL Workbench installed in your machine (pre-requisite to have installed beforehand) 
```

### Installing

All of these programmes can be easily found by searching them on Google, since these versions can be updated I will not be displaying a specific link for them.


## üîß Running the tests and Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

If you just follow through all the videos step-by-step what is being explained, you will be certainly more than golden.
However, the main purpose here was to compile all the spring boot 2 exercises
because you will be able to execute also all of them in your terminal 
getting the desired results.
